Create an overview of the best-suited technologies for developing a Snake video game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Include a comprehensive summary of the technologies, methods, and practices that will facilitate creating a smooth, responsive, and visually appealing Snake game.

# Key Elements to Consider

- **HTML Structure**: Explain how HTML will be used to lay out the basic elements of the game, such as the container for the game board. Highlight the importance of a well-structured HTML for enabling proper interactions between CSS and JavaScript.

- **CSS for Styling and Animation**: Describe how CSS can be utilized for crafting the visual presentation, including styling the Snake, food, and the game area. Go over specific techniques to create smooth animations and transitions to make the gameplay visually appealing, while also maintaining performance.

- **JavaScript for Game Logic**: Provide an overview of how JavaScript will be essential for controlling the game logic, such as the Snake's movement, collision detection, score tracking, and more. For each of these key JavaScript components, briefly introduce the methods or libraries that can add efficiency and modularity, such as employing ES6 classes to organize game behavior.

- **Canvas API for Rendering**: Discuss the use of JavaScript's Canvas API for creating a more dynamic game experience, such as rendering the game area and entities more efficiently.

- **Handling User Input**: Explain which methods are optimal for capturing user inputs in JavaScript, such as keyboard events for controlling the direction of the Snake, while ensuring responsiveness.

# Output Format

Present a structured overview in paragraph form. Each technology or method should have its own paragraph describing its purpose, how it should be used in this project, and what its specific contribution to developing the Snake game would be.

# Examples

### Example 1: JavaScript Snake Movement
- **Input**: Use 'arrow keys' to control Snake's movement.
- **Implementation**: Map arrow key events to update the direction of the Snake in the JavaScript game loop, ensuring that canvas re-renders appropriately.

### Example 2: CSS Animation Techniques
- **Input**: Smooth game-over transition.
- **Implementation**: Use CSS transitions for a fade-out effect combined with JavaScript logic for end-game announcements.

### Example 3: Use of Canvas API
- **Input**: Draw the Snake and food.
- **Implementation**: Utilize the Canvas API to render game elements dynamically, allowing for faster rendering and enabling more responsive gameplay.

# Notes

- Emphasize only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies suitable for someone with a foundational knowledge of web development.
- Provide practical and straightforward implementation methods and techniques, focusing on a smooth and engaging user experience.
- Highlight specific techniques to enhance code readability and scalability, such as modularizing JavaScript code components. 

Create a complete project structure for developing a Snake video game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Provide a well-defined structure for the main project files and folders, specifying how to organize the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any additional resources for optimal development. Ensure that the project setup supports creating a clean, scalable, and cohesive Snake game.

# Key Elements to Include

- **Project Folder Overview**: Outline how the entire project folder should be organized, including subfolders for HTML files, styling (CSS), JavaScript logic, assets, and additional tools or libraries.

- **HTML File(s)**: Indicate which file(s) are required for rendering the game in the browser, including a suggestion for maintaining a clean file by separating scripts and styles into their own respective files. Specify the file name and how to integrate JavaScript and CSS parts.

- **CSS Folder and Styling**: Describe the folder and name conventions for storing CSS styling files. Provide suggestions for styles that should be organized within these files. Highlight which parts of the game visuals should be handled here, such as game container layout, Snake design, or animations.

- **JavaScript Folder and Game Logic**: Define the JavaScript file structure for handling game logic, such as snake movement, collision detection, score handling, and event control. Give guidance on splitting logic into individual modules or ES6 classes to foster clean code organization (e.g., a separate module for game initialization and another for rendering).

- **Assets Folder**: Include a folder structure for storing images or other assets, like sounds, that may be needed for future additions to make the game more engaging. Mention examples such as icons, food items, or sounds used when the player achieves points.

- **ReadMe and Documentation**: Recommend adding a README.md file to provide an overview of the project, how it works, and how to run it. Suggest including a brief description of how each of the folders contributes to the game.

# Steps

1. **Project Folder Setup**: Create a folder named snake-game as the root of the project.
    - Create subfolders: /css, /js, /assets.
    - Add core files: index.html, /css/style.css, /js/game.js.

2. **HTML Setup**:
    - File: index.html
    - Description: Main entry point of the game, incorporating JavaScript and CSS.
    - Recommend including clean semantic tags as the root for the game interface.

3. **CSS Styling**:
    - File: /css/style.css
    - Describe logically dividing parts into sections, such as container styling vs game visuals.

4. **JavaScript Game Logic**:
    - Files: /js/game.js, consideration for splitting (movement.js, collision.js)
    - Include a separate file for initializing game entities.

5. **Assets**:
    - Folder: /assets
    - Add placeholder files for future elements like sounds or images representing food icons.

6. **README**:
    - Provide basic setup instructions: cloning, running on a local server.

# Output Format

Present a clear and detailed step-by-step guide on the creation of the directory and file structure. Each step should include what a developer should expect to add to each file or folder, ensuring cohesiveness and scalability for future improvements to the game.

# Examples

### Example: Folder structure
- **Input**: How should the project be structured?
- **Output**:
    
snake-game/
        ├── index.html
        ├── css/
        │   └── style.css
        ├── js/
        │   ├── game.js
        │   ├── movement.js
        │   └── collision.js
        ├── assets/
        │   ├── food.png
        │   └── game-over.mp3
        └── README.md


### Example: JS File Division
- **Input**: How can the game logic be divided?
- **Output**: Use /js/game.js for general game setup, /js/movement.js for handling snake positional updates, and /js/collision.js for collision detection logic.

# Notes

- Emphasize creating a scalable and maintainable project structure.
- Avoid over-complicating; make it accessible for someone with foundational web development skills.
- Future additions (like assets and sound effects) should be accounted for in the folder structure from the beginning.  contesta en español
