# Prompts Cursor

## 1. 

I'd like to make a game similar to super mario but I know nothing about it tech, architecture or anything besides the game mechanics.
can you help me design this project? let's do it in a step by step way, first taking decisions, documenting and when I feel this is ready I will let you know to start the coding phase

## 2.

1.1 player will move running and jumping. the running speed will increase a little if the running button remains pressed. the strength of the jump will increase to a specified max the longer the jump button is pressed.
1.2 lets start with only the goomba like enemy that can be stomped on and will disappear after this.
1.3 reach the end of the level (finish line)
2.1. PC and web based
2.2 male it simple
3.1 pixel art
3.2 fantasy

## 3.

lets modify target platform to only web based for step 1.
as for step 2.
1. lets go with the simplest for a small project
2.1 handles movement, jumping, interact with enemy, interact with finish line, interact with something that causes a game over like being hit by an enemy
2.2 simple behavior move left to right in a determined space
2.3 lets start with a single level with floor terrain, some holes that needs to be jumped on, suspended in the air platforms and pipe-like structures that must be jumped on but instead of pipes we use tree trunks
2.4 main menu, playing, paused, game over
3.1 main menu, playing, paused, game over

before we proceed to next step, should we start documenting this design and decisions phase in a markdown README.md file?

## 4.

proceed with next step

## 5.

there is also a game over condition when the player falls through a hole of the map

do these newly defined decisions go into the README or in specific documents? if specific documents then how do i name them?

## 6.

I have added GDD and TDD documents in a folder named `docs` is this ok? If so, then lets proceed with next phase

## 7.

for my step 2 i cannot find KinematicBody2D. My godot version is 4.3

## 8.

my CollisionShape2D is added to my Sprite2D? or to my CharacterBody2D? its also showing a warning specifying

A shape must be provided for CollisionShape2D to function...

## 9.

i need assets for these nodes? where do you propose i create these assets

## 10.

created a pixel art character .png with an ai tool, how do i configure my godot

## 11.

how do i run my scene

## 12.

lets stop a bit on this project and figure out if we can change the approach as I dont have experience with godot or unity tools. Can we make a simpler game web based with html5, css and javascript? what would we need if we tried this approach?

## 13.

lets start this project again based on this. Start by modifying any markdown documents that needs to be updated

## 14.

ok, now where to start based on this updated documents

## 15.

provide a terminal script to create this folder structure

## 16.

i have now this basic structure running, what would be out next step?

## 17.

lets modify jumping behavior for bigger jumps the longer the button is pressed up to a maximum

## 18.

is my file up to date with latest changes to jump?

## 19.

i have errors accessing variables before declared, restructure this file

## 20.

can we add some sort of mechanism for the jumping not to be so strong with a single press? like ease the jump a bit with a lighter button press

## 21.

this looks better. what is our next step?

## 22.

lets start with step 1 but before proceeding, is there anything on the documentation to update?

## 23.

ok lets go back to step 1

## 24.

lets try adding a second enemy in one of the platforms to see the behavior

## 25.

the enemy should move above the platform and its currently moving inside the platform. The platform should work as the floor

## 26.

can we expan the canvas horizontally by 30%?

## 27.

perfect. now update the layout for this new width, add a hole in the floor around the mid

## 28.

somehow game is currently allowing for double jumps, fix this

## 29.

the enemies should move left-right in the platforms they are positioned, enemy number

## 30.

lets review this a little, platform enemy moved to the floor somehow and stopped moving, and floor enemy is moving above the hole

## 31.

lets work with green enemy, is currently standing still

## 32.

now lets move blue enemy to the bottom right floor side

## 33.

lets expand the platforms to different widths, bottom one with the enemy to twice the size and top right to triple the size

## 34.

bottom blue enemy stopped moving

## 35.

it still static in the ground 

## 36.

my blue enemy is still fixed position in the ground and not moving in its platform

## 37.

after testing this changes i can see its still not moving. can you review the entire script and fix it?

## 38.

have a quick review on my script.js according to the context and let me know if there is any code missing or incorrectly structured?

## 39.

can we make the game scenario a fixed width that is larger than the current canvas, and when moving through the scenario the camera will move to the left or the right with the player?

## 40.

can we make it so the player cannot go into a platform from below, it will generate a collision and stop the jump

## 41.

when you say replace existing checkCollisions, what happens to current existing code?

## 42.

ok now when colliding with a platform, player can still trigger a jump and will go through it, lets fix this

## 43.

i can still trigger a jump after colliding with a platform from below

## 44.

still triggering jumps on platforms when colliding from below

## 45.

nope, we still running in the same issue with triggering a new jump when colloding from the platform from below

## 46.

ok lets review the entire file and find the possible bugs on the implementation

1. player is now starting below the ground
2. still can trigger a jump when colliding from a platform from below that will go through the platform


also make the platforms height the same as the ground

## 47.

now enemies stopped moving, and i can keep myself stuck to a platform from below if i dont let go of the jump buttojn

## 48.

can still keep the player stuck to the platform from below if colliding and not letting go of the jump button

## 49.

still not fixing the issue

## 50.

good, its no longer sticking to the bottom of the platform but the jumping can be triggered again after colliding which creates an air jump that we dont want to happen 

## 51.

yes, and at the end propose folder structure and names for these files. also provide a osx terminal script to create this files considering im in the root folder of my project 

## 52.

lets keep on refactoring the code, most of my js files are empty atm

## 53.

i have 2 InputManager in my basecode, which one is the latest one and which one should i delete

## 54.

perfect lets continue with the refactor

## 55.

lets stop for now, review the entire code base and find out what needs to be fixed or cleansed @fantasy-platformer 

## 56.

ok lets apply the recommended fixes

## 57.

i have reindexed the project. can you redo a validation on the code base and find out any areas that need to be improved or fixed @fantasy-platformer 

## 58.

first lets fix the js exception in player class "Uncaught ReferenceError: GAME_CONSTANTS is not defined"

## 59.

input manager is throwing an exception "InputManager.js:28 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bind')"

## 60.

game is not loading anything now, can you review the project and find and fix any potential issues @fantasy-platformer  

## 61.

jump is no longer working as expected, its like there is a huge invisible platform where first platform is located @fantasy-platformer 

## 62.

my player is starting in the air and falling through the ground to non-visible anymore

## 63.

now i cannot jump @fantasy-platformer 

## 64.

player is overlapping with ground and still not able to jump

## 65.

still cannot jump but the positioning is now fixed

## 66.

ok lets restart first getting the project current state and trying to make a first stable version. I will test and let you know what i find, start by reading the project codebase 

## 67.

first lets fix an issue with the ground level and the player be on it and not above it

## 68.

no, lets now fix the issue with the player not jumping

## 69.

this is still not fixing the jump issue, can you change the approach also read the entire codebase and find any potential issues?

## 70.

jump issue is fixed but the player is not colliding to the ground after jumping but going through it, also cannot jump after going through it

## 71.

now the jump doesnt stop at ground but go beyond it into the depths of hell

## 72.

still persisting

## 73.

this is working now, i triggered a game over by colliding with an enemy and got a js error "Game.js:106 Uncaught TypeError: this.player.reset is not a function"

## 74.

now my player vanished from existence

## 75.

new obtained error is 
```
Game.js:107 Uncaught TypeError: this.enemyManager.reset is not a function
```

## 76.

how many player lives we have?

## 77.

can we show the lives counter in the top left corner in a maybe visual way as like horizontal dots one per life?

## 78.

lets add a menu screen when starting the game. It will show the game in the background fixed and provide a button that says "New game" when pressing enter or clicking with the mouse it will start a new game

## 79.

flawless, now lets work on a similar screen for game over. it will show 2 buttons, restart or main menu. can move down and up, the buttons will have some kind of state that will show which button is currently under focus. when pressing enter it will then trigger the action. for restart the game is restarted with full lives for main menu it will go back to the menu

## 80.

when losing a life the game over menu shouldnt appear but the game should restart with the life counter lowered by one. when no more lives and losing again the game over menu should appear. modify the code with this requirement

## 81.

there is weird bug after losing a life to an enemy, when moving after respawning the game states move the player back to like a new respawn without the life.

in example
player starts with 3 lives
player loses to an enemy
player respawns with 2 lives
player moves a bit
player respawns with 2 lives
game resumes as normal

## 82.

good, its working better now, lets modify to let the player play with 0 lives left. after losing with zero lives the game over menu is shown

## 83.

ok now as for the menu screens, lets start by highlighting the button on focus which will trigger when pressing enter. This could be making the color more opaque or something easy to understand from a UX perspective

## 84.

ok this looks better. at the game over menu, id like to being able to move between buttons with arrow keys and trigger the action with the enter button. 

## 85.

the main menu button is not working on game over menu, it starts the game again and should return to main menu

## 86.

still not working, return to menu is restarting the game insteaf of going to the main screen where the new game button is located

## 87.

still not working and i cannot move the game over menu with the arrow keys

## 88.

i dont see any changes applied, can you review and provide the fixed methods or initializations again?

## 89.

still not working both buttons on game over return the game to the new game state, where main menu should return to the main menu

## 90.

nope, not corrected. also I cannot move through the game over menu with the arrow keys

## 91.

review the entire code base and try to find why the game over menu is not working with the arrow keys but only with the mouse

## 92.

nope, didnt fix my issue

## 93.

now they are not working in the gameplay

## 94.

gameplay arrow press working, game over menu not working

## 95.

we need to figure out a way to make the arrows work for both gameplay and game over menu, currently is not working for game over menu

## 96.

still not working, should we isolate the menu logic from the other js implementation?

## 97.

review my @Game.js and let me know if there is any code to be removed, updated or is this is well coded?

## 98.

ok lets apply separation of concerns first

## 99.

console showing an error

## 105.

lives mechanic stopped working

## 106.

new error shown in console

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'current')
    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (main.js:6:28)

## 107.

whener i move i get an error

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'current')
    at MenuManager.handleKeyDown (MenuManager.js:23:33)

## 108.

ok this is now working a lot better, the game over menu though is still not working with the arrow keys

## 109.

this fixed the menu arrow keys event handling. now whenever i click main menu with the mouse it goes back to the main menu but when i do it with enter button it goes back to game state of playing

## 110.

this solution didnt solve the issue

## 111.

i dont see any differences with provided solution and the current codebase

## 112.

still not working, pressing Main Menu from the mouse click does work as inteded but pressing enter button on main menu isnt working as intended. Perhaps the issue could have to do with the arrow key not tracking which button is on the focus?

## 113.

this solution is the same we had before, and it doesnt work for the game over menu button pressing with enter. Can you review everything again before providing a new solution? we are on loop where we apply a change and roll it back and apply the same change and roll it back

## 114.

we went back to another tried solution, its also not working with the enter button, its triggering a new game when it should go back to the main menu as the on click event does

## 115.

this didnt fix the issue, try again a different approach

## 116.

perfect this works, lets stop here for a bit and add this a base stable version in my repository. provide all the commands to be used on the terminal to initilialize this project on git and upload it to the origin. for origin use @https://github.com/rafajdm/mario-game.git 

## 117.

modify this and lets add the entire project with root folder mario-game, this is the folder that contains the folder fantasy-platformer

## 118.

the folder already exists, review the entire codebase. we are not located at mario-game folder which is the root. Validate the structure, propose the creation of any files you think we should include and then proceed to initialize the git project using provided origin

## 119.

should i remove the assets folder from fantasy-platformer? I havent added my files to git, currently ran the command mkdir docs assets

## 120.

lets modify the code a bit, falling into a hole (below ground level) will cause a life lost

## 121.

lets add a finish line, whenever you reach the finish line you get button that will say Level completed!

## 122.

lets make the finish line a yellow column from ground to highest X, also lets fix the ground as currently at the end there is a huge hole that is not allowing the completion as it cannot be jumped above

## 123.

there seems to be a bug when jumping as soon as landing in a platform that makes the player go through that platform (as if the platform isnt solid)

## 124.

im currently standing still and jumping when i want and randomly the player goes through the ground or platform it is standing instead of landing on it

## 125.

still happening but i cannot identify the trigger

## 126.

collisions with enemies stopped working but the bug that makes the player go through the platform also seems to be fixed

## 127.

now lets make the holes bigger, but dont make them the same, one hole make it twice it size, the next one keep it small, and the third one make it just enough for a full jump to cover the distance 

## 128.

lets commit this changes to git
